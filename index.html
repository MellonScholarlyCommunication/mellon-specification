    The goal of the mellon project is to design a framework that enables scholarly communication over a decentralized network, where researchers can retain ownership and control over their published research.
In order to design this framework, different approaches to distributed networks have to be considered, and technical limitations have to be overcome. 
   <p>In <a href="#scholarly-communication">§ 2 Scholarly communication</a>, the requirements and vision for scholarly communication are explained.
In <a href="#architecture">§ 3 Architecture of a Decentralized Network for Scholarly Communication</a>, an architecture is proposed for scholarly communication over decentralized networks based on pod based data storage.
The artefacts required for scholarly communication are listed in [[$artefacts]].
For the proposed architecture, concrete use-cases are worked out in <a href="#usecases">§ 6 Scholarly Communication context</a>.
From these use-cases, requirements are derived in <a href="#requirements">§ 8 Requirements</a>.</p>

    For scholarly communication to be successful, <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">four core functions</a> have to be fulfilled. 
   <table style="width:100%">
    <tbody>
     <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000;">
      <th style="width: 20%; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px;">Function
      <th style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px;">Explanation
     <tr>
      <th>Registration
      <td>Allowing claims of precedence for a scholarly finding
     <tr>
      <th>Certification

     <tr>
      <th>Awareness
      <td>Enabling actors in the scholarly system to remain aware of new claims and findings
     <tr>
      <th>Archiving
      <td>Preserving the scholarly record over time
   </table>
   <p>These four functions are required in the network to be able to do scholarly communication.
In the context of a decentralized network, registration can also be viewed as a way to link researchers to their institutions, allowing for trust in the validity of the researcher and their research.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2.2" id="research-centric-model"><span class="secno">2.2. </span><span class="content">Researcher-centric scholarly communication model</span><a class="self-link" href="#research-centric-model"></a></h3>
    The goal is that researchers’ pods are hosted by their respective institutions, as part of the infrastructure provided in support of research and education. When a researcher moves on to another institution, the pod moves along and becomes hosted by the new institution. Researchers without institutional affiliation or with multiple affiliations can opt for commercial pod hosting platforms, national/regional academic hosting provisions that can be assumed to emerge, or host the pod themselves. Over time, a researcher’s pod accumulates an overview of scholarly contributions made throughout a career path. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2.3" id="institutions-decentralized-network-trust"><span class="secno">2.3. </span><span class="content">The role of institutions in a decentralized scholarly communication network</span><a class="self-link" href="#institutions-decentralized-network-trust"></a></h3>
    As decentralized networks do not have a single central service that actors can trust, actors in the network require an approach that allows them to trust other actors present in the network. 
   <p>In these networks, institutions can take on the role as the orchestrators of a decentralized scholarly communication network.
These orchestrators connect the registered researcher pods with the available service hubs in the network, and serve as a trusted mediator between the researchers and the service hubs.
Service hubs can trust all researcher pods registered to / making use of a trusted orchestrator (managed by an institution), as they trust that every researcher pod registered to / using that orchestrator is managed by a person affiliated with the managing institution of that orchestrator.
In the other direction, researchers registering their pods to / using the orchestrator managed by their institution trust the service hubs advertised by that orchestrator.
In the case of problems, the institution can change from / advertise multiple different service hubs, by changing the policies.</p>
   <p>This way, institutions actively participate in the decentralized network of scholarly communication as orchestrators and trusted parties.</p>

    The researcher pod serves as the main hub for a researcher, serving as a storage module for scholarly artefacts and interactions, and for exchanging information with external service providers and institutions. 
   <p>A researcher pod stores the following information:</p>

    The orchestrator is a component in the network that is responsible for orchestrating the control flow of the network.
This control flow is dictated by the policies that are imposed by the network.
An orchestrator component is initialized with a set of policies.
These policies are retrieved and indexed by the orchestrator.
Based on these available policies, a control flow is created. 
   <p>The orchestrator exposes an inbox to the network.

Institutions participate in the decentralized scholarly communication network by providing orchestrator services to the network. In this way, an institution can manages their affiliated researchers using these orchestrators. 
The orchestrators connect researcher pods with a relevant set of service hubs that enable the researcher pod to fulfill all the <a href="#functions-scholarly-communication">functions of scholarly communication</a> In its role as an orchestrator, it can set policies that are enforced in the communication between the research pods and the service hubs.</p>

    Service hubs provide services to the network.
These services are necessary to enable the execution of the <a href="#functions-scholarly-communication">functions of scholarly communication</a> by the network.
Service hubs are a way to decentralize the functionality that is currently primarily contained to centralized services.
Orchestrators have a choice between all the available service hubs in the network to, and can require one (or multiple) of the available service hubs to be used by the affiliated researcher pods to fulfill a function of scholarly communication. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="3.4" id="collector"><span class="secno">3.4. </span><span class="content">Collector</span><a class="self-link" href="#collector"></a></h3>
    A Collector is a service that collects and indexes information on the artefacts in the network.
It collects this information from the available service hubs in the network. (It might make sense to also allow collectors to retrieve information directly from researcher pods. Else the interaction artefacts have to pass through a service hub that can be retrieved by a collector in the network. Also it can bypass service hubs if they are not willing to provide all required information themselves / only partly).
It stores information about the available artefacts, and the linked lifecycle events and interaction artefacts.
The collector provides an outward API that enables querying of the artefact information in the network. It can also provide indexing information to enable clients to filter over the exposed data. (This might be an interesting use case for event streams!).
In the case of multiple distributed networks, collectors can collect data from / refer to other collectors in other networks to enable evaluating queries over all linked networks.

    The scholarly dashboard is the interface that can be used by researchers to execute the lifecycle events of an artefact (publish an artefact, review an artefact, interact with an artefact, ...)
(This dashboard may also include functionality for direct interactions between researchers, however this is out of scope for a basis scholarly dashboard).
A scholarly dashboard can be managed by an institution, requiring users to provide login credentials of said institution. (or be from external parties providing other possibilities / interactions?)

    The scholarly browser is the interface that can be used by anyone to query the distributed network for information on scholarly artefacts.
It provides information about the artefact, as well as lifecycle events and the available interactions with the artefact.

    Actors inside (and outside) the network may be interested in following specific research topics, authors, ... .
This is a core function of scholarly communication: <a href="#functions-scholarly-communication">Awareness</a>.
For scholarly communication, it should be possible to subscribe on all lifecycle events of artefacts in the network (for which an actor has the correct permissions).
This can be handled by the available <a href="#service-hub">Service Hubs for awareness</a> present in the network. <a href="#collector">Collectors</a> present in the network can also pose as an awareness service hub, as it indexes lifecycle information of all artefacts present in the network
These <a href="#service-hub">Service Hubs for awareness</a> should be equipped to enable actors in the network to subscribe to specific lifecycle information for research artefacts that match given filter criteria.
E.g. an actor should be able to subscribe to creation lifecycle events of artefacts tagged with "Scholarly Communication".
The service hub should be able to advertise the available options for filtering research, and the lifecycle information which can be subscribed to. 
   <h2 class="heading settled" data-level="5" id="policies"><span class="secno">5. </span><span class="content">Policies</span><a class="self-link" href="#policies"></a></h2>
    In a decentralized network setting, policies can be used to dictate the control flow of the network in a dynamic way.
A policy dictates a function that should be executed for an input matching a certain condition.
In the case of Scholarly Communication, a policy defines a service call that should be done for an input scholarly artefact matching a given form.
By adapting the policies, the control flow in the network can be changed dynamically.
Enforcing a set of policies MUST result in an unambiguous control flow. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="5.1" id="policy-format"><span class="secno">5.1. </span><span class="content">Policy Format</span><a class="self-link" href="#policy-format"></a></h3>
    As multiple actors in the network must create and process policies, there is a requirement for a unified format for these policies.
The choice of format MUST enable orchestrating entities in the network to enforce the policy, and provide proof of enforcement.
The format must also help resolve problems if conflicting policies are 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="5.1.1" id="policy-triggers"><span class="secno">5.1.1. </span><span class="content">Triggers</span><a class="self-link" href="#policy-triggers"></a></h4>
    A policy can be seen as a trigger, that executes a function when the trigger condition is fulfilled.
A trigger contains: 
   <ul>
    <li data-md>
     <p>A condition - in this case more specifically a data shape. This shape is used to match a received item.</p>
    <li data-md>
     <p>A trigger function - in this case a service call. This is used to call the indicated service with the received item.</p>
   </ul>
   <p>On receiving an input, the orchestrating entity will try to match the input with the data shapes of the retrieved policies (triggers).
In case of multiple matching triggers, all triggers are executed according to the available <a href="#policy-priority">policy priority</a> information.
The trigger execution consists of a function call to the indicated service.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="5.2" id="policy-enforcement"><span class="secno">5.2. </span><span class="content">Policy enforcement</span><a class="self-link" href="#policy-enforcement"></a></h3>
    Policies in the network MUST be enforced by the orchestrating entities in the network.
In this network architecture, the <a href="#orchestrator">Orchestrator</a> is responsible for enforcing policies in the network. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="5.2.1" id="policy-enforcement-proof"><span class="secno">5.2.1. </span><span class="content">Proof of policy enforcement</span><a class="self-link" href="#policy-enforcement-proof"></a></h4>
    In some cases, proof of enforcement may be required.
E.g. A research institution requires a certain set of policies to be enforced for affiliated researchers, and should be able to verify if the required policies have been enforced on artefact submission.
For this, the orchestrating instance is required to store an event-log of the processed requests and the enforced policies.
Through this event log, it MUST be possible to prove that all required policies were enforced for every step.
This event log MUST be stored redundantly, to prevent and discover tampering. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="5.3" id="policy-sources"><span class="secno">5.3. </span><span class="content">Policy sources</span><a class="self-link" href="#policy-sources"></a></h3>
    In the decentralized network, multiple actors may require policies to be enforced.
In the case of scholarly communication, the institution, the faculty, the research group and the researcher can all impose policies to be enforced for scholarly artefacts. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="5.3.1" id="policy-inheritance"><span class="secno">5.3.1. </span><span class="content">Policy inheritance</span><a class="self-link" href="#policy-inheritance"></a></h4>
    Policy inheritance enables the extension of a set of policies with additional policies.
This is required in the e.g. the case of a research institution with multiple faculties.
The institution can provide a core set of policies for the institution, that is extended for each faculty with specific policies relevant to the artefacts created in that faculty.
This is achieved by referencing the inherited policies with a predefined policy-inheritance predicate.
This way, the orchestrating instance can retrieve the chain of policies. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="5.4" id="policy-priority"><span class="secno">5.4. </span><span class="content">Policy Priority</span><a class="self-link" href="#policy-priority"></a></h3>
    When multiple sources provide sets of policies to the orchestrating instance, multiple policies may be retrieved that match for a received artefact.
In the cases where the order of execution of policies is important, priority information can be required for policies in the network.
In case of multiple matching policy rules for a received artefact, the priority information can be used to decide the order of policy evaluations.

    In order to create or interact with artefacts in a scholarly communication network, a user must have a valid data pod environment to store these (interaction) artefacts.
In order for these artefacts to be taken into the scholarly record, they have to be passed to the respective service hubs that fulfil these functions.
For this to be possible, the data pod must have access to an orchestrator in the network, that will ensure that the created artefacts can follow the correct steps to be included in the scholarly record.

    Bob has created a new research paper.
Bob wishes to add the artefact to the network.
Bob opens the scholarly dashboard, and navigates to the upload section.
Bob selects the artefact he wishes to add, and completes all required information that cannot be automatically extracted from the uploaded artefact.
On submission, the scholarly dashboard stores the artefact in the data pod of Bob on the designated location (designated by Bob, or designated by the shape tree present in the pod).
The scholarly dashboard receives the information for all relevant service hubs from the orchestrator.
The artefact data is sent to all relevant service hubs (At least the registration service hub for claims of precedence).
The created lifecycle events are stored on Bob’s data pod, and are distributed to all subscribed actors in the network via the awareness service hub.

    Bob wishes to add relevant datasets for a previous published paper (by him) in the network.
In the case the published paper is not his, an approach is needed that allows the original creator of the linked artefact to accept the new link.
Bob opens the scholarly dashboard, and navigates to the upload view.
Bob uploads the new artefact.
Bob selects the artefact that the new artefact is linked to in a "Link" section of the view.
On submission, the scholarly dashboard stores the artefact in the data pod of Bob on the designated location (designated by Bob, or designated by the shape tree present in the pod).
The scholarly dashboard receives the information for all relevant service hubs from the orchestrator.
The artefact data is sent to all relevant service hubs.

    Bob has some questions over an artefact created in the network.
Bob opens the scholarly dashboard, and navigates to the artefact view.
Bob selects the option to add a new comment.
In the new comment view, Bob writes his comment and submits.
The dashboard stores the comment and the relevant data on Bob’s data pod.
The scholarly dashboard retrieves the awareness and archiving service hub information (registering interactions is not necessary?).
The archiving service stores the comment and indexes it to be retrievable with the data for the original (multiple?) referenced artefact(s).
The awareness hub extracts the artefact(s) that are referenced by (in) the comment, and notifies all actors subscribed to these artefacts of a new interaction lifecycle event.
Here we present some use-cases for interacting with artefacts in the network.

    Actors in the network SHOULD be able to subscribe to artefact lifecycle events for artefacts in the network.
Additionally, actors MAY be able to subscribe to the events of new actors being added to the network.
Actors SHOULD be able to subscribe to only specific event types linked to specific artefacts, that can be filtered by the actor on the available dimensions of artefacts in the network.
These filters on the dimensions of the artefacts can be achieved using shape matching.
E.g. an actor in the network should be able to subscribe for notifications of specific lifecycle events of artefacts where the artefact has a tag of "Scholarly Communication".
(This should be indexed in a way that not all filters have to be evaluated with shape matching for each lifecycle event, as this is not scalable.)

    Bob wishes to subscribe to all artefacts created by Alice in the network, to receive updates of all new lifecycle information of her artefacts.
Bob uses the scholarly dashboard and navigates to the subscription page.
The scholarly dashboard retrieves the awareness subscription hub information from the used orchestrator.
The subscription service hub advertises the available dimensions on which artefacts in the network can be filtered, and the available lifecycle information to which can be subscribed.
The scholarly dashboard represents these options to Bob.
Bob decides to filter the artefacts based on their author, and enters the webId of Alice into the filter.
Bob decides to subscribe to the "create" and "publish" lifecycle events.
On submission, the availability service hub saves the subscription, and on subsequent relevant lifecycle events of artefacts with Alice as the author, Bob receives a notification of these events.
The subscription is also stored with the necessary metadata on Bob’s pod, allowing Bob to easily list and undo created subscriptions.

    Bob wishes to undo a specific subscription because of too much events.
Bob navigates to the subscription page of the scholarly dashboard.
All previous subscriptions are listed on the page.
Bob selects a subscription, and chooses the remove option.
The awareness service hub is notified that the specific subscription should be removed.
On success from the service hub, the scholarly dashboard removes the subscription from Bob’s pod.

   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.2" id="rq-interaction-artefact-storage"><span class="secno">8.1.2. </span><span class="content">Artefact Linking</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-interaction-artefact-storage"></a></h4>
    Research artefacts (Papers, images, datasets, ...) can be interacted with in the network.
These interactions MUST link to the artefacts they interact with.
Artefacts may also contain links to artefacts they cite, to their used datasets, ...
In case two way coupeling is required for these interactions, a mechanism is required to notify the pod storing the other artefact to return a link / provide the option to link back. This can be handled automatically, or require manual interaction to veryify. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.3" id="rq-metadata-storage"><span class="secno">8.1.3. </span><span class="content">Metadata Storage</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-metadata-storage"></a></h4>
    Artefacts in the network have metadata, and will require this metadata to be stored and linked to the original artefacts.
There are multiple solutions to store metadata for (non-)rdf data on a Linked Data Platform. However, it may benefit applications to support multiple approaches to metadata storage, and fall back on less ideal approaches in case the required metadata cannot be discovered. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.3.1" id="meta-file"><span class="secno">8.1.3.1. </span><span class="content">.meta file</span><a class="self-link" href="#meta-file"></a></h5>
    A straightforward way to store file metadata on a Linked Data Platform is making use of a .meta file. As the .meta is a naming convention, for every file the .meta file can be automatically retrieved.
However, lately this seems to have been getting less and less traction in the community? 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.3.2" id="describedby"><span class="secno">8.1.3.2. </span><span class="content">describedby / seeAlso metadata</span><a class="self-link" href="#describedby"></a></h5>
    Metadata can be provided in a more semantic way using predicates as <code>rdf:seeAlso</code>.
This metadata can be stored in the location where the relevant resource is stored. 
A downside to this however is that if a resource is directly retrieved, this information will not be retrieved, and the metadata reference will be lost to the application retrieving the resource. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.3.3" id="link-seeAlso"><span class="secno">8.1.3.3. </span><span class="content">Link header</span><a class="self-link" href="#link-seeAlso"></a></h5>
    A third solution is to provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#link-relation-describedby">Link Relations</a> This solution returns the link to the metadata file in the response header of the HTTP request.
Using this solution in combination with the previous solution of providing the link to the metadata file in the RDF data where the resource is stored, provides the most complete approach to storing metadata for a resource. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.4" id="rq-data-discovery"><span class="secno">8.1.4. </span><span class="content">Data Discovery</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-data-discovery"></a></h4>
    Data discovery is required for external services to retrieve artefacts from a researcher pod, on being notified of new data.
There should be a semantic way for external applications and services to discover the locations of certain types of artefacts and their metadata, and retrieve this data, given the correct permissions.
Currently, <strong>shape trees</strong> are considered as the go-to approach to enable data discovery on linked data platforms. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.5" id="rq-location-aware-storage"><span class="secno">8.1.5. </span><span class="content">Location aware data storage</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-location-aware-storage"></a></h4>
    External services that need to post data to the researcher pod (e.g. registration service hub returning a certificate of registration) need to be aware of the location where they can post this data.
The <strong>shape tree</strong> approach used for data discovery can also be used to make the actor posting data aware of the location where data matching a given shape should be posted. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.6" id="rq-artefact-versioning"><span class="secno">8.1.6. </span><span class="content">Artefact versioning</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-artefact-versioning"></a></h4>
    Versioning is a concept that is very relevant for scholarly communication, as certain artefacts (datasets, papers, ...) can be iterated upon (incorporating reviews, ...).
In order to support this behavior, a versioning system must be in place that allows for actors in the network to retrieve different versions of the same research publication.
This versioning system also should take into account the available lifecycle event information for the artefacts in question (Using the avialable lifecycle information, an actor in the network SHOULD be able construct the whole timeline of an artefact: creation, updates, publication, interactions, ...).
This concept could also be applied for interaction artefacts (e.g. see comments on proposed edits, see updates of made comments, ...) 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.7" id="rq-permissions"><span class="secno">8.1.7. </span><span class="content">Permissions</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-permissions"></a></h4>
    Permissions are an important tool for data pods to protect private information.
Only actors with the correct permissions set have access to resources in a pod environment.
In pod environments, permissions are handled using ACL files.
Permissions are required in case certain parts of the research are sensitive (e.g. datasets with sensitive information), or should not yet be public (e.g. in-progress work to share with colleagues). 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.7.1" id="rq-set-permissions"><span class="secno">8.1.7.1. </span><span class="content">Setting permissions</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-set-permissions"></a></h5>
    Functionality must be in place for all allowed to set permissions in a data pod.
This requires that researchers are able to allow e.g. a scholarly dashboard to edit the permissions of their data pod (for specific locations). 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.1.7.2" id="req-group-permissions"><span class="secno">8.1.7.2. </span><span class="content">Group permissions</span><a class="self-link" href="#req-group-permissions"></a></h5>
    Setting permissions for individual actors can be insufficient at times.
Applications built on the Mellon framework SHOULD enable actors to to create, edit, and delete permissions for groups of actors.
Creating or updating a permission group MUST have the consequence that the permissions of this group are applied on the new permission group, and are removed from actors that are removed from the permission group.
This can be useful for e.g. creating a permissions group for your research group, so that permissions for created research can be automatically granted for the whole research group, instead of needing to set all permissions individually. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="8.2" id="rq-events"><span class="secno">8.2. </span><span class="content">Events</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-events"></a></h3>
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.2.1" id="rq-notifications"><span class="secno">8.2.1. </span><span class="content">Notifications</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-notifications"></a></h4>
    Notifications are required for the scholarly dashboard to notify the user of new information (received from e.g. the awareness service). 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.2.1.1" id="rq-notification-filtering"><span class="secno">8.2.1.1. </span><span class="content">Notification filtering</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-notification-filtering"></a></h5>
    A scholarly dashboard application SHOULD be able to filter notifications based on preset shapes.
This enables the scholarly dashboard to filter the notifiactions for relevant lifecycle information of searched artefacts. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.2.1.2" id="rq-notification-based-actions"><span class="secno">8.2.1.2. </span><span class="content">Notification based actions</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-notification-based-actions"></a></h5>
    In the case that notifications are used to notify of important artefact lifecycle information (in the case this is not directly posted to the researcher pod because of design reasons?), fucntionality is required that can evaluated the received notifications and execute automatic actions.
This can be avoided by making notifications non-essentialy by posting the important life cycle events directly to the data pod, and making the notifications secondary to this and only point out the locations of the newly added data. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="8.3" id="rq-orchestrator"><span class="secno">8.3. </span><span class="content">Orchestrator</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-orchestrator"></a></h3>
    The orchestrator is an actor in the network that is responsible for executing policies on received artefacts in the network.
For all received policies, the orchestrator should filter relevant policies for the current action, and provide a proof of enforcement for each policy.
Policy filtering can be achieved using <a href="#rq-policy-shapes">shape matching</a> solutions. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.3.1" id="rq-orchestrator-interface"><span class="secno">8.3.1. </span><span class="content">Orchestration interface</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-orchestrator-interface"></a></h4>
    The interface for an orchestration service is an inbox advertised by the orchestrator.
This inbox serves as an event-queue, from which the orchestrator pulls notifications if available.
As the inbox is open, it can be posted to by all actors in the network. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.3.2" id="rq-orchestrator-policies"><span class="secno">8.3.2. </span><span class="content">Orchestrator policy retrieval</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-orchestrator-policies"></a></h4>
    The orchestrator matches and enforces policies on received lifecycle events of artefacts in the network.
But these policies have to first be retrieved / passed to the orchestrator.
For this, both the client and the institution managing the orchestrator can provide an interface for the orchestrator to retrieve relevant policies. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.3.3" id="rq-"><span class="secno">8.3.3. </span><span class="content">Orchestrator policy enforcement</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-"></a></h4>
    The enforcing of policies is handled by first matching the relevant policies to a received artefact lifecycle event, 
and subsequently executing the attached triggers.
Proof of this execution should be possible, to verify the artefact path through the network, and to verify for the institution that the rules have been enforced.
For this, a proof of execution could also be required by the service hubs, to know that a received submission is approved by (the automated rules of) a certain institution in the network. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="8.4" id="rq-policy"><span class="secno">8.4. </span><span class="content">Policies</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-policy"></a></h3>
    Functionality is required for actors to enforce policies on data being generated / submitted / ... in the network. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.4.1" id="rq-policy-shapes"><span class="secno">8.4.1. </span><span class="content">Shape matching</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-policy-shapes"></a></h4>
    Shape matching functionality can be a vital part of enforcing certain policies for actors to match the shape of artefacts and their metadata in case of RDF data. 
Shape matching makes use of a shape ontology, for which both <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">shacl</a> and <a href="https://shex.io/">shex</a> are currently the most relevant shape ontologies.
In case of non-rdf data, other solutions can be explored?. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5" id="rq-service-hubs"><span class="secno">8.5. </span><span class="content">Service hubs</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-service-hubs"></a></h3>
    In this sections the requirements for the different service hubs are listed. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.1" id="rq-service-discovery"><span class="secno">8.5.1. </span><span class="content">Service hub discovery</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-service-discovery"></a></h4>
    Service hubs in the network MUST be discoverable via advertisement of a service hub by orchestrators in the network. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.2" id="rq-service-interactions"><span class="secno">8.5.2. </span><span class="content">Service hub interactions</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-service-interactions"></a></h4>
    Service hubs MUST advertise the specific services they provide.
Multiple service hubs may be used simultaneously to fulfil the same service (e.g. a researcher may register his created artefacts at multiple service hubs). 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.3" id="rq-service-functions"><span class="secno">8.5.3. </span><span class="content">Service hub functions</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-service-functions"></a></h4>
    Here the different available services in the network are listed.
The proposed registration tokens are not bindingm and could be replaced by other verification mechanisms (see <a href="#rq-verification">§ 8.6 Verification mechanics</a>). 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.3.1" id="rq-registration-service"><span class="secno">8.5.3.1. </span><span class="content">Registration service</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-registration-service"></a></h5>
    A registration service MUST provide a token of registration to the pod where the submitted artefact is stored. This token MUST be timestamped to allow actors in the network to verify claims of precedence.
A copy of this token (and the submitted artefact) MUST be stored locally, to allow for verification by actors in the network, and should be provided to an archiving service. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.3.2" id="rq-certification-service"><span class="secno">8.5.3.2. </span><span class="content">Certification service</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-certification-service"></a></h5>
    A certification service MUST compare a submitted artefact with the current <em>state-of-the-art</em> in the respective field.
If the submitted artefact is novel, the service MUST provide a certification token to the pod where the submitted artefact is stored.
A copy of this token (and the submitted artefact) MUST be stored locally, to allow for verification by actors in the network, and should be provided to an archiving service. 
   <h6 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.3.2.1" id="rq-peer-review-service"><span class="secno">8.5.3.2.1. </span><span class="content">Peer review service</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-peer-review-service"></a></h6>
    In the case of peer reviews, the a service may be setup that forwards a submitted artefact to a set of peers the network for review.
The reviews of these MUST be returned to the service (before a set deadline), where the service will return a token with the attached reviews. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.3.3" id="rq-awareness-service"><span class="secno">8.5.3.3. </span><span class="content">Awareness service</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-awareness-service"></a></h5>
    The service MUST advertise the available dimensions of the artefacts on the network for which an actor can subscribe (e.g. title, tags, creator, ...).
Next to artefacts, an awareness service MAY also advertise new actors (researchers / service hubs / ...) connected to the network.
The service MUST provide an interface for actors in the network to subscribe to specific lifecycle events of artefacts that can be filtered on all advertised dimensions.
The awareness service MUST update all relevant subscribers of new information in the network.
The service MUST provide an interface to undo specific subscriptions. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="8.5.3.4" id="rq-archiving-service"><span class="secno">8.5.3.4. </span><span class="content">Archiving service</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-archiving-service"></a></h5>
    An archiving service MUST store all submitted artefact data it receives.
The service MUST provide an interface to retrieve specific data from the service. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="8.6" id="rq-verification"><span class="secno">8.6. </span><span class="content">Verification mechanics</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-verification"></a></h3>
    A scholarly communication network requires a way for actors in the network to verify data and entities in the network. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.6.1" id="rq-profile-verification"><span class="secno">8.6.1. </span><span class="content">Researcher profile verification</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-profile-verification"></a></h4>
    A method MUST be in place for actors in the network to check the profile information of researchers in the network.
This authentication requires the institution the researcher is affiliated with to provide an interface or a digital token to the researcher using which the verification can be done. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.6.2" id="rq-publication-verification"><span class="secno">8.6.2. </span><span class="content">Artefact data verification</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-publication-verification"></a></h4>
    An actor in the network MUST be able to verify an artefact in the network at the service hubs specified in the artefact metadata. E.g. An actor can verify the registration of the artefact by for example verifying a registration token available for the artefact at the registration service hub specified in the artefact metadata or lifecycle events. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.6.3" id="rq-publication-verification①"><span class="secno">8.6.3. </span><span class="content">Service hub verification</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-publication-verification①"></a></h4>
    An actor in the network MUST be able to verify a called service in the network. This can prevent malicious actors from re-routing actors to malicious services.
This can be resolved using simple public / private key-based solutions 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="8.7" id="rq-collector"><span class="secno">8.7. </span><span class="content">Collector</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-collector"></a></h3>
    The Collector services in a network collect the generated knowledge, and make it available for clients querying the network.
In the case of scholarly communication, there are multiple approaches. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.7.1" id="rq-collector-archiving-service"><span class="secno">8.7.1. </span><span class="content">Archiving service providing querying capabilities</span><a class="self-link" href="#rq-collector-archiving-service"></a></h4>
    As an archiving service collects and archives the scholarly record of the network, this information could be queried by clients.
This however brings the risk of the archiving service having a monopoly on both the archiving and making public of the scholarly record in the network,
where these services can provide their own browser for their own archived data. 
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="8.7.2" id="separate-collector-instance"><span class="secno">8.7.2. </span><span class="content">Separate collector instance</span><a class="self-link" href="#separate-collector-instance"></a></h4>
    Separate collector services may be added to the network.
These services can subscribe to the available awareness service hubs on the network to be notified of new information in the network.
The initial state of the collector service will have to be synchronized by requesting the scholarly record from the available archiving services that should be indexed. 
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="8.8" id="ontology"><span class="secno">8.8. </span><span class="content">Ontologies</span><a class="self-link" href="#ontology"></a></h3>
    Thought should be given to what ontologies are to be used to semantically describe the artefacts and events. The use of different ontologies could mean that more or less compatibility layers are required for the framework to interact with different scholarly communication frameworks outside of its network.
